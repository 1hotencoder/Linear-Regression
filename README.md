# Linear Regression [![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
### Look Ma, No Libraries. :) 

- Performs Linear Regression with **ZERO** import statements (Except if you want visualization, then matplotlib is imported)
- Considers the last column as the dependant variable and all non-numeric data as catagorical.
- Automatically performs One-Hot Encoding on all non-numeric columns.
- Also calculates and displayes the R^2 value for the test set.

This is more of a programming exercise than it is a data science exercise, but helpful to anyone trying to get into either.
As no libraries are imported (not even pandas or numpy :) ), even the most trivial tasks like [generating random numbers](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Python) and reading CSV files are handled organically.

All suggestions/PRs welcome.
